<h4><em>Introduction</em></h4>
<hr>

The D52 disassembler allows the user to specify memory areas as code,
binary data (8 or 16 bit), ascii text, address tables, or data that should
be ignored (not disassembled). You may specify such areas in an ascii text
file with the same name as the file to be disassembled, but with an extension
of <em>ctl</em> (for example: program.ctl controls the disassembly of program.hex or
program.bin).
<br><br>
With the use of a control file, you can, by an iterative process, get a
progressively more meaningful disassembly by modifying the control file
based on examination of the output of previous runs of the disassembler.
You can also specify names for labels and symbols in the control file,
resulting in a much more readable source file.
<br><br>
Labels and symbols may have as many characters as will fit in one line of
the control file, but some cross assemblers (and especially cross linkers)
will truncate any more than some fixed number of characters. Consult your
cross development tool documentation. Labels and symbols are not case sensitive.
<br><br>
The control file may exist in either the current directory or the
directory of the file to be disassembled. If it is in both directories,
the control file in the current directory will take precedence. The
output file will always be placed in the current directory.
<br><br>
The
<a href="#starting">getting started</a>
section of this document gives some minimal information
for users who are eager to try out the disassembler. For best
use of the disassembler, however, you should read the sections on
<a href="#options">command line options</a>
and
<a href="#directives">control file directives</a>
before proceeding.
<br><br>
Much of the information in this manual also applies to the 8048 and Z80
disassemblers. Invoking the disassemblers without any command line
parameters will display a list of options.
<br><br>

<a name="disclaimer"><em>Disclaimer</em></a><hr>
D52 is a tool for educational use and for recovering source code that has been
lost or is unavailable.
<em>Disassembling a program may be unethical or illegal under some circumstances.</em>
It is your sole responsibility to determine whether use of D52 for a particular
purpose is both legal and ethical.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<a href="#topofdoc">Back to top</a><br>

<a name="starting"></a>
<h4><em>Getting Started</em></h4>
<hr>

D52 is a command line disassembler. To disassemble a file called 'program.bin'
or 'program.hex', type in (at the command line prompt):

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d52 -d program</td></tr>
</table>

A control file with the same name as the file to be disassembled, but with
an extension of '.ctl' can be created in which you can specify areas of
memory to be ascii text, 8-bit binary data, 16-bit binary data, etc.
A control file is not necessary for disassembly, but as will be seen,
it will provide for a much more complete disassembly. The
<a href="#toption">t option</a>
will cause D52 to trace and analyze the code before disassembly, and will
create a preliminary control file.

<br><br>
If a file extension is not provided and neither the
<a href="#boption">b option</a>
nor the
<a href="#hoption">h option</a>
is specified on the command line, the disassembler will first search for a hex
file and, if it is not found, will then search for a bin file. The disassembler
can be forced to look for only one or the other by specifying either the
<a href="#boption">binary</a>
or the
<a href="#hoption">hex</a>
option on the command line:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d52 -db program</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>for the file program.bin, or</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d52 -dh program</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>for the file program.hex</td></tr>
</table>

If a file extension of '.hex' or '.bin' is provided in the filename (ie: d52 test.hex),
that is equivalent to using the
<a href="#hoption">h option</a>
or
<a href="#boption">b option</a>.
<br><br>

D52 will produce a file named 'program.d52' containing the disassembly of
the 8051/8052 instructions in the original hex or binary file. It is
very useful on the first few disassemblies to use the
<a href="#doption">d option</a>
, which adds a comment field to every line. The comment field contains the
hexadecimal address of each instruction, the hex data for each byte in
the instruction, and the ascii code for each byte of the instruction.
<br>Example:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(opcode/operands)</td><td>(address)</td><td>(data)</td><td>(ascii)</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>orl a,#42h</td><td>; 0df6</td><td>44 42</td><td>DB</td></tr>
</table>

This makes it easy to spot areas of ascii text or other nonexecutable
code, and you can then modify the control file to tell the disassembler
that these areas should be treated as some other kind of data on subsequent
disassemblies. Please see the section on
<a href="#directives">control file directives</a>
for specific information.
<br><br>

By examining the output file and then modifying the control file based
on the information obtained, you can get a progressively better disassembly
of your program. Generally, about half a dozen iterations of the disassembly
are enough to produce a very readable source file that can then be modified
and reassembled.

<br><br>
<a href="#topofdoc">Back to top</a><br>

<a name="options"></a>
<h4><em>Command Line Options</em></h4>
<hr>

Command line options modify the operation of the disassembler.
They may be specified on the command line using either Unix style
options:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d52 -db filename</td></tr>
</table>

or DOS style options:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d52 /d /b filename</td></tr>
</table>

Options may be entered in a freeform fashion (in any order or format)
provided that any options preceeding the filename of the program to be
disassembled must begin with either a dash (-) or a slash (/). For example:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d52 /db filename -x1000</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d52 filename -d b x1000</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d52 -d filename bx1000</td></tr>
</table>

all mean exactly the same thing and will cause the disassembler to
behave in exactly the same way. Exceptions are that the
<a href="#xoption">X option</a>
, if used, must be the last option given, and if both the
<a href="#aoption">A option</a> and the
<a href="#soption">S option</a>
are used, the S option must preceed the A option.
<br><br>
Note that the file name specified on the command line does <em>not</em>
include the .hex or .bin extention.
<br><br>
Command line options are:
<hr>

<a name="aoption"></a>
<h4><em>A Option (ascii macro)</em></h4>

The A option tells the disassembler to change the db/defb pseudo op to
the ascii macro (pseudo op 'ascii' instead of 'db' or 'defb') for areas
defined as ascii text. This will cause the disassembler to include a
macro definition in the disassembly output file that should expand to
'db' for the cross assembler. To use this option, your cross assembler
must be able to handle macros, and in particular, D52's macro format.
If used in conjunction with the
<a href="#soption">S option</a>
, the S option must come first on the command line.
<br><br>
There are some caveats regarding the ascii macro. The intent of
this macro is to make ascii text easier to find in the output file.
Once you're satisfied with the readability of the output file, you
may want to run the disassembler once more without the A option to
produce a file compatible with your cross assembler.
<br><br>
Some cross assemblers treat certain characters within a macro as
special meta-characters. The Huntsville Microsystems HMA8051, for
example, regards the characters '#', '.' and '\' as special within a
macro. If these characters occur in ascii text using the ascii macro
of D52, the assembler will do strange and not so wonderful things with
them. If this happens, just do not use the A option (by default, it is off).
<br><br>
A problem that will be common with all cross assemblers is that
the disassembler does not currently treat the single quote (')
character differently than it does other characters within
ascii text. Since the disassembler delineates ascii text (whether using
the A option or not) with the single quote character, its presence
in ascii text areas will cause problems. The only solution to this is to
manually edit the output file of the disassembler or to define the byte
of the single quote as a binary byte in the control file (see the
<a href="#bdirective"> B control file directive</a>
).

<a name="boption"></a>
<h4><em>B Option (read binary file)</em></h4>

The B option forces the disassembler to read a binary file
(extention '.bin') instead of an Intel hex file (extention .hex).
If neither the B option nor the
<a href="#hoption">H option</a>
are specified, the disassembler will first search for a file with an
extention of .hex, and if not found, will then search for a binary
file with an extention of .bin.

<a name="doption"></a>
<h4><em>D Option (put data in comment field)</em></h4>

The D option tells the disassembler to include a comment field
in each disassembled line. The comment field will contain the
hexadecimal address of each instruction, the hex data for each
byte in the instruction, and the ascii code for each byte of the
instruction. Example:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(opcode/operands)</td>
      <td>(address)</td><td>(data)</td><td>(ascii)</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>orl a,#42h</td>
      <td>; 0df6</td><td>44 42</td><td>DB</td></tr>
</table>

This makes it easy to spot areas of ascii text or other nonexecutable
code, and then modify the control file to tell the disassembler that
these areas should be treated as some other kind of data on subsequent
disassemblies. Please see the section on

<a href="#directives">control file directives</a>

for specific information.

<a name="hoption"></a>
<h4><em>H Option (read hexadecimal file)</em></h4>

The H option forces the disassembler to read an Intel hex file
(extention '.hex') instead of a binary file (extention '.bin').
If neither the
<a href="#boption">B option</a>
nor the H option are specified, the disassembler will first
search for a file with an extention of '.hex', and if not found,
will then search for a binary file with an extention of '.bin'.

<a name="ioption"></a>
<h4><em>I option (add include for 'sfr52.inc' file)</em></h4>

The I option adds this line to the .d52 disassembly file:

<br><br>
<pre>
	include	"sfr52.inc"
</pre>
<br><br>

The file 'sfr52.inc' includes equates for 8052 special function registers
and SFR bits that may be needed by some cross assemblers. The sfr52.inc
file <em>should be modified to suite your 8052 cross assembler</em>
since the equates required will vary from assembler to assembler.
For example, one cross assembler I test with requires the equate for
'acc', and yet another cross assembler not only does not require it,
but will generate an error if it is present. You may also need to
edit the 'include' pseudo-op in the disassembly file if your cross
assembler uses some other pseudo-op to include files (or edit the
source file 'd52p2.c' and recompile).
<br><br>
It is best to start out with all the equates in sfr52.inc commented out,
find out what undefined label errors your cross assembler generates,
then uncomment the required equates in sfr52.inc.
<br><br>
This option is incompatible with the
<a href="#koption">K option</a>.

<a name="koption"></a>
<h4><em>K Option (disassemble for Keil's A51 assembler)</em></h4>

Tells D52 to generate source code compatible with the older Keil A51 assembler.
<br><br>
<i><b>NOTE:</b> Newer versions of Keil's A51 assembler (tested with version 7.10)
have come into compliance with the rest of the world. <b>Do not</b> use this option
with newer versions of A51.</i>

<a name="noption"></a>
<h4><em>N Option (use C type operands)</em></h4>

Use this option to have the disassembler output hexadecimal operands using C
notation, ie: 0xcd instead of the default 0cdh.

<a name="poption"></a>
<h4><em>P Option (add dot in front of pseudo ops)</em></h4>

Some assemblers require pseudo operations to begin with a dot. Use this option
to have the disassembler output ".equ" instead of "equ" and similar for org and
other pseudo operations.

<a name="soption"></a>
<h4><em>S Option (set string pseudo op)</em></h4>

This option tells the disassembler to generate the pseudo ops
'defb' and 'defw' instead of 'db' and 'dw' for those cross
assemblers that may require this. Most cross assemblers understand
'db' and 'dw', so these are the defaults for the disassembler. Use
this option for cross assemblers that do not recognize 'db' and
'dw'. If used in conjunction with the
<a href="#aoption">A option</a>
, the S option must preceed the A option on the command line.

<a name="toption"></a>
<h4><em>T Option (trace and analyze code)</em></h4>

This option tells D52 to trace and analyze the 8052 code before disassembling it.
D52 will attempt to determine which parts of the code are actually code, and
which parts are ascii text, binary data, pointers, etc. While it does a reasonably
good job of analyzing the code on most files, no program can do as good a job as
a human programmer. A control file with the same name as the hex or bin file, but
with an extension of '.ctl', will be created before the actual disassembly is
performed. You can then edit the control file to correct any erroneous directives,
or to add new directives.

<br><br>
<em>Warning:</em> Using this option will <em>overwrite</em> any control file
that may already exist for the code file being disassembled. It is intended to
be used on the <em>first</em> disassembly only.

<a name="uoption"></a>
<h4><em>U Option (upper case output)</em></h4>

Causes labels, symbols, mnemonics, etc to be output in upper case, for cross
assemblers that may require upper case code. Comments, literal data values,
strings, and other output are not affected by this option.

<a name="xoption"></a>
<h4><em>X Option (add hexadecimal offset to addresses)</em></h4>

This option causes the disassembler to add a hexadecimal offset
to the address of every location in the code file. This may be
useful for disassembling code that was read from the second (or
subsequent) rom of a set of roms. For example, suppose that
binary data was obtained from a set of 4K byte eproms (call them
rom1 and rom2). Then the first file should be disassembled with
the command line:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d52 -d rom1</td>
</table>

and the second should be disassembled with the X option:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d52 -d rom2 x1000</td>
</table>

The two files then can be combined into one and all references
within the disassembled code will be to the correct addresses.
<br><br>
If given on the command line, the X option overrides any <a href="#odirective">
O directive</a> in the control file.

<a name="zoption"></a>
<h4><em>Z Option (read cycle count file - d52 only)</em></h4>

Jan Waclawek has added code to generate cycle counts for all three disassemblers.
In addition, d52 can read customized cycle count files for 8052 derivatives.
See the <a href="#zdirective">Z directive</a> for more information.

Please read Jan's documentation in the 'cyclefiles' directory.

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d52 -zfilename</td>
</table>

Many thanks to Jan for a great job!

<br><br>
<a href="#topofdoc">Back to top</a><br>

<a name="directives"></a>
<h4><em>Control File Directives</em></h4>
<hr>

Control directives tell the disassembler to treat specified areas
of the code to be disassembled as something other than executable
code. The user specifies control directives by editing (with any
text editor) a control file with the same name as the file to be
disassembled, but with a file extention of .ctl (eg: program.ctl
to control the disassembly of the file program.hex or program.bin).
A generic control file called 'generic.ctl' is provided to get the
user started. Copy 'generic.ctl' to 'file.ctl' where 'file' is the
name of the binary or Intel hex file to be disassembled, and modify
as required based on the output of the disassembler. Then run the
disassembler again to get a more readable disassembly of the code.
<br><br>
All directives consist of a character that specifies the type of data,
followed by a hexadecimal number specifying the value or range of
values of the data. In the case of a
<a href="#ldirective">label</a>
or
<a href="#sdirective">symbol</a>
directive, the hexadecimal number is followed by ascii text defining
the label or symbol. See individual directives for examples. All
directives must be in the first column of the line. Directives may be
complete words, but only the first character is significant, ie:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Label</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>reset</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>and</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>looney</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>reset</td></tr>
</table>

will both generate the label "reset" for address 0. Note that they
are not case sensitive.
<br><br>
Numerical values must be in hexadecimal and may optionally be preceeded by
"0x". For example, a hexadecimal number may be entered as "1234" or
"0x1234". Either will be interpreted as the number 1234H.
<br><br>
Everything following a semi-colon (;) is a comment and will be
ignored by the disassembler.
<br><br>
Label and symbol directives differ in that a label refers to an
address and a symbol refers to any 8 or 16 bit immediate data.
Therefore an opcode such as

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>r2,#data</td></tr>
</table>

will cause the disassembler to search only the symbol table for a
matching value whereas an opcode such as

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>dptr,#data</td>
  </tr>
</table>

will cause the disassembler to search the label table first, and
if no matching value is found, to then search the symbol table.

<br><br>
Symbols apply only to immediate data. To specify a symbol for an 8052
data memory location, use the
<a href="#rdirective">R directive</a>
, or to force name substitution for an operand at a given address, use the
<a href="#xdirective">X directive</a>.
<br><br>

Single values are specified by entering just the value; ranges of
values are specified by a start and stop address separated by a dash
(-), or by a start address and count separated by a plus (+), ie:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>t 1000</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>
      <td>the data at address 1000H is ascii text.</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>t 1000-1010</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>
      <td>the data from address 1000H to (and including)
          address 1010H is ascii text.</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>t 1000+6</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td>
      <td>ascii text starting at 1000H for 6 bytes.</td></tr>
</table>

Directives are processed in the order in which they are read from
the control file. Specifying an area as ascii data and then later
specifying it as data to be ignored (uninitialized data) will cause
that area to not be disassembled at all. Care must be taken in
specifying areas in the control file.


<a name="adirective"></a>
<h4><em>A Directive (address data)</em></h4>

Specifies that the address contains a word value corresponding
to an address for which a label should be generated. For example,
a vector table may be located at address 0x1000 containing four
entries. The user can modify the control file by adding the
following entry:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>a 1000-1007</td></tr>
</table>

This will cause the disassembler to generate the following
output lines:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>dw</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>vec1</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>dw</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>vec2</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>dw</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>vec3</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>dw</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>vec4</td></tr>
</table>

assuming that the control file also contains entries for the
values found at those addresses to generate the labels vec1
through vec4. The addresses referenced will be flagged so
that labels will be generated in the output file at those
addresses.

<a name="bdirective"></a>
<h4><em>B Directive (byte binary data)</em></h4>

Specifies that the data is to be interpreted as 8 bit binary
data. For example:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>b 1000-1007</td></tr>
</table>

tells the disassembler that the data from address 1000H to 1007H
should generate the line:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>db</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7</td></tr>
</table>

assuming that the data at address 1000H and up is 00H, 01H, etc.

<a name="cdirective"></a>
<h4><em>C Directive (code data)</em></h4>

Forces the disassembler to interpret the data as executable code.
This may be necessary because the disassembler skips over strings
of 00H or ffH bytes that occur since they are unlikely to be real
code. However, sometimes programmers insert several NOPs for timing
purposes.

<a name="ddirective"></a>
<h4><em>D Directive (define data type (label or symbol))</em></h4>

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d address [0 or label]</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>search label table only</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d address [1 or symbol]</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>search symbol table only</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d address [2 or none]</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>don't search either table</td></tr>
</table>

Forces the disassembler to search only the label or symbol table. This
allows you to specify a label and a symbol for the same value. For example:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov dptr,#1234</td>
  </tr>
</table>

would normally search only the label table assuming that the data refers
to a code address. If the data is really a constant with the same value as
a label, then

<table summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>d 1 address</td></tr>
</table>

will force the disassmbler to look only in the symbol table for the string
that represents the value of the data. The address is the address of the
opcode, not the code location of the data operand.
<br><br>
Note that the last parameter can be either a number (0, 1, or 2) or a word
(label, symbol, none). If the last parameter is a word, only the first
character is checked for L, S, or N, and is not case sensitive.

<a name="fdirective"></a>
<h4><em>F Directive (SFR label definition)</em></h4>

Causes reference to an SFR (special function register) to
generate a label for the specified SFR address. This is useful
for naming SFR's for non-standard members of the 8052 family.
For example, suppose that some manufacturer designs a new 8052
variant and decides to use address efH as a new special function
register called 'NEWREG'. Then by adding:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>f ef newreg</td></tr>
</table>

to the control file, D52 will disassemble the opcodes f5 ef as:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>newreg,a</td></tr>
</table>

instead of:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0efh,a</td></tr>
</table>

SFR label names are limited to fifteen characters.

<a name="idirective"></a>
<h4><em>I Directive (ignore data)</em></h4>

Tells the disassembler to ignore a range of addresses that may be
initialized by the input file. This is useful when the input file
is a binary file generated by an eprom programmer that dumps the
entire eprom space. The valid data from a 4K eprom might only be,
say, 3K in length. By adding

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>i c00-fff</td></tr>
</table>

to the control file, you tell the disassembler to not disassemble
the data from address 0c00H to 0fffH.

<a name="kdirective"></a>
<h4><em>K Directive (SFR bit definition)</em></h4>

As with the
<a href="#fdirective">F directive</a>
, you can give a name to a new SFR bit. If a new variant of the 8052
family adds a new interrupt, for instance, its enable bit in the IE
register might be bit 6. By adding:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>k ae newint</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(ae is the address of IE.6)</td></tr>
</table>

you define bit 6 of the interrupt enable register to be 'ie.newint'.
Like SFR label names, SFR bit names are limited to fifteen characters.

<a name="ldirective"></a>
<h4><em>L Directive (label definition)</em></h4>

Defines a label to the disassembler. Labels are generated in the
output disassembly file whenever a reference to the address is
found and the label exists in the label table. Suppose that
address 0000H contains the code 01 43 (ajmp 0043H). Then the entry

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>l 43 start</td></tr>
</table>

in the control file will cause D52 to disassemble this code as:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>ajmp</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>start</td></tr>
</table>

rather than:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>ajmp</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>X0043</td></tr>
</table>

The code beginning at address 43H will then have the label
'start' in the label field rather than the label 'X0043'. See
the entry for the
<a href="#sdirective">S directive</a>
for an explanation of the difference between labels and symbols.

<a name="mdirective"></a>
<h4><em>M Directive (bit addressable memory label)</em></h4>

Similar to the
<a href="#kdirective">K directive</a>
, the M directive gives a name to a bit addressable memory location. Example:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>m 12 bitflag</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(12h is the bit address of 22h.2)</td></tr>
</table>

would cause the bytes d2 12 to be disassembled as

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>setb</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>bitflag</td></tr>
</table>

instead of

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>setb</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>22h.2</td></tr>
</table>

As with the K directive, names are limited to fifteen characters.

<a name="ndirective"></a>
<h4><em>N Directive (suppress address label generation)</em></h4>

The disassembler will generate labels for addresses that are referenced by code
such as

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>dptr,#6</td></tr>
</table>

If the operand represents a constant rather than an address, you can suppress
the automatic generation of a label (X0006) for address 6h by entering

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>n 6</td>
</table>

in the control file. You'd want to make sure that address 6h isn't legitimately
addressed by some other code before using this directive.

<a name="odirective"></a>
<h4><em>O Directive (add hexadecimal offset to addresses)</em></h4>

This directive causes the disassembler to add a hexadecimal offset to the address
of every location in the code file. See the <a href="#xoption">X option</a>
for details. It will be overridden by any <a href="#xoption">X option</a>
specified on the command line. If the <a href="#toption">T option</a> (trace and
analyze code) is given on the command line, the O directive has no effect since
any existing control file will be rewritten. In this case you must use the command
line X option to specify an offset.

<a name="pdirective"></a>
<h4><em>P Directive (patch inline code)</em></h4>

This directive is of dubious value, but has been added for anyone who might find
it useful. The P directive is similar to the
<a href="#commentdirective">comment directive</a>
except that the user supplied string is patched into the output stream as
<i>code</i>, not as a comment. You could, for instance, patch in a macro
definition or an include statement. Patching in executable code is not a real
good idea.

<a name="rdirective"></a>
<h4><em>R Directive (register definition)</em></h4>

This directive specifies a name for an 8052 register. Direct
accesses to registers will normally be disassembled as:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
       <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>rb2r5,a</td></tr>
</table>

in the case of register 5 of register bank 2. If the user
determines that register 5 of bank 2 is being used as a loop
counter, for example, he can give it the name loop by adding:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>r 15 loop</td></tr>
</table>

to the control file, and the above code will be disassembled as:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>loop,a</td></tr>
</table>

The R directive can assign a name to any internal memory location
below the SFR address space.

<a name="sdirective"></a>
<h4><em>S Directive (symbol definition)</em></h4>

Defines a symbol to the disassembler. Symbols are output to the
disassembly file whenever the value is encountered in the input
file and the symbol exists in the symbol table. The user can
specify a symbol for a value by a line such as:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>s 20 space</td></tr>
</table>

Code which uses this value, such as:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>a,#20h</td>
  </tr>
</table>

will then be disassembled as:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>a,#space</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Labels and symbols differ in that a label applies to an address,
whereas a symbol applies to any 8 or 16 bit immediate data. For
code which can only refer to values, such as

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>a,#20h</td>
  </tr>
</table>

only the symbol table will be searched for a matching value. For
code which could refer to either an address or a value, such as:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>dptr,#1234h</td>
  </tr>
</table>

the label table will be searched first, and only if no matching
value is found will the symbol table then be searched. This search
behavior can be modified by use of the
<a href="#ddirective">d directive</a> or the
<a href="#xdirective">x directive</a>.

<a name="tdirective"></a>
<h4><em>T Directive (text [ascii] data)</em></h4>

Forces the data in the range specified to be disassembled as
text (ascii data). Thus the code: 48 69 20 74 68 65 72 65 at
address 1000H will be disassembled as:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>db</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>'Hi there'</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>or</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>ascii</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>'Hi there'</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>(command line option A used)</td></tr>
</table>

by putting the line:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>t 1000-1007</td></tr>
</table>

in the control file. Otherwise it would be interpreted as:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>orl</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>a,r0</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>; 1000</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>48</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>H</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>xrl</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>a,r1</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>; 1001</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>69</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>i</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>jb</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2eh.4,X106d</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>; 1002</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>20 74 68</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>th</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>xrl</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>a,72h</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>; 1005</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>65 72</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>er</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>xrl</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>a,t3</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>; 1007</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>65 ff</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>e.</td></tr>
</table>

which is unlikely to be what was intended by the original
programmer. Data specified by this directive is not checked
to verify that it really is ascii data--be careful.

<a name="wdirective"></a>
<h4><em>W Directive (word binary data)</em></h4>

Specifies that the data is to be interpreted as 16 bit binary
data. For example:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>w 1000-1007</td></tr>
</table>

tells the disassembler that the data from address 1000H to 1007H
should generate the lines:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>dw</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>dw
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>dw
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>dw
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr>
</table>

assuming that the data at address 1000H and up is 00H, 00H,
00H, 01H, 00H, 02H, etc. This differs from the A (address)
directive in that the
<a href="#adirective">A directive</a>
also causes a reference to be made to the indirect address.
In other words, if the data at address 1000H is 1234H, the A
directive will cause a label (X1234) to be put in the output
file at address 1234H, whereas the W directive will not.

<a name="xdirective"></a>
<h4><em>X Directive (specify name for operand data)</em></h4>

Specify a name for an operand at a particular address. This is similar
to the
<a href="#sdirective">S directive</a>
except that it applies only to the given address. For example, if the
<em>symbol</em> 'CR' is defined as 0dh, every instance of 0dh as an operand will
have the symbol 'CR' substituted. It may be, however, that the value
0dh has a different meaning when used as an operand for a particular
instruction. The X directive allows you to modify the interpretation
of an operand at specific operand locations. Why not then use the X
directive exclusively? Because that would force you to place an X
directive in the control file for <em>every</em> instance in which
that value appeared as an operand. The S directive, defined only once
for an operand value, will substitute the symbol text for <em>every</em>
occurrance of that operand value unless overridden by the X directive.
Note that the address defined in the X directive is the address of the
operand, not the address of the instruction. For example:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>X 102 loopinit</td></tr>
</table>

forces substitution of the text 'loopinit' for the operand located at
address 102h. Therefore an instruction that should be interpreted as

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>r0,#loopinit</td></tr>
</table>

will not be disassembled as

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>r0,#CR</td></tr>
</table>

if the control file contains the above x directive, and also contains an
<a href="#sdirective">S directive</a>
defining 0dh as 'CR', and the value of the operand for the mov
instruction happens to also be 0dh.

<a name="ydirective"></a>
<h4><em>Y Directive (specify name for operand data but suppress EQU generation)</em></h4>

This is similar to the X directive except that the disassembler will not
generate an EQU statement for the operand value in the output file. This should
be used when you want to specify a name for an operand that is an assembler
pseudo-op such as LOW() or HIGH().

<a name="zdirective"></a>
<h4><em>Z Directive (specify code for which to generate cycle count information)</em></h4>

Specify addresses for which cycle count information will be added in the
disassembly file. Also see the <a href="#zoption">Z option</a>.
<br>
Please read Jan's documentation in the 'cyclefiles' directory.

<a name="commentdirective"></a>
<h4><em># Directive (header comment string)</em></h4>

Defines a comment string to be output prior to disassembly at
the specified address. For example:<br><br>

<!-- This is one time we DO want to use <pre> -->

<pre>
        # 95
        # 95 Start of initialization
        # 95
</pre>
<br><br>
in the ctl file would cause the output<br><br>
<pre>
        ;
        ; Start of initialization
        ;
                clr  ea           ;0095     c2 af     B/
</pre>
<br><br>
assuming that the code 'c2 af' was located at address 0x95.
Since ASCII strings consume prodigious amounts of memory, it is
wise to use this directive sparingly. It is, however, useful for
marking blocks of code that have been identified in previous
runs of D52.

<a name="icommentdirective"></a>
<h4><em>! Directive (inline comment string)</em></h4>

Defines a comment string to be output after disassembly at
the specified address. For example:<br><br>

<!-- This is one time we DO want to use <pre> -->

<pre>
        ! 95 Start of initialization
</pre>
<br><br>
in the ctl file would cause the output<br><br>
<pre>
                clr  ea           ;0095     c2 af     B/    ; Start of initialization
</pre>
<br><br>
for the above example. Note that inline comments are only available for code
and word data, and will do nothing if the data at the specified address is defined
as data other than code or word data (ascii text, for example).

<br><br>
<a href="#topofdoc">Back to top</a><br>

<a name="symnote"></a>
<h4><em>A Note on Symbols, Labels and Names</em></h4>
<hr>
An example will best explain the difference between labels, symbols, operand
names and register names. Labels refer to program code locations, symbols
refer to immediate operands, register names and operand names refer to data
memory locations.
<br><br>

<em>Given the hex or binary file produced from the follow source code:</em>
<br><br>

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>org</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>30h</td></tr>
  <tr><td>main</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>a,30h</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>30h,r0</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>r1,#30h</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>sjmp</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>main</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>end</td></tr>
</table>

<br>
<em>and this control file:</em>
<br><br>

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td>l 30</td><td>main</td><td></td><td>; label for code address</td></tr>
  <tr><td>x 33</td><td>thirty</td><td></td><td>; name for operand at address 33h</td></tr>
  <tr><td>s 30</td><td>alsothirty</td><td></td><td>; symbol for immediate operand</td></tr>
  <tr><td>r 30</td><td>counter</td><td></td><td>; name for data memory address (register) at 30h</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>

<em>D52 will produce the following output:</em>
<br><br>

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td>;</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td>org</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>30h</td></tr>
  <tr><td>;</td></tr>
  <tr><td>main:</td><td></td><td>mov</td><td></td><td>a,counter</td><td></td><td>; 0030   e5 30</td><td></td><td>e0</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td><td></td><td>thirty,r0</td><td></td><td>; 0032   88 30</td><td></td><td>.0</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td>mov</td><td></td><td>r1,#alsothirty</td><td></td><td>; 0034   79 30</td><td></td><td>y0</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td>sjmp</td><td></td><td>main</td><td></td><td>; 0036   80 f8</td><td></td><td>.x</td></tr>
  <tr><td>;</td></tr>
  <tr><td>counter</td><td></td><td>equ</td><td></td><td>30h</td></tr>
  <tr><td>alsothirty</td><td></td><td>equ</td><td></td><td>30h</td></tr>
  <tr><td>thirty</td><td></td><td>equ</td><td></td><td>30h</td></tr>
  <tr><td>;</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td>end</td></tr>
  <tr><td>;</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>

Note that the label, symbol, register name, and operand name all have
the same value: 30h. But the operand name directive (
<a href="#xdirective">x directive</a>) in
the control file specifies the <em>address</em> of the operand (in
this case 33h), and the other three control file directives refer to
the <em>value</em> of the operand. The x directive allows you to use
a different name for the same value (unlike a symbol), so that, for
example, an operand value of 0dh in one place can be disassembled with
the name 'CR' and in another place as, say, 'loop_init_count'.

<br><br>

<a name="outfile"></a>
<h4><em>Format of Output File</em></h4>
<hr>

The output file for D52 (extention '.d52') contains 8052 instructions
and pseudo ops in a format that should be acceptable to any 8052
cross assembler. When assembled, the source file should produce an Intel
hex file or binary file that is identical to the original. Identical, in
this case, means that the code is the same, not that it necessarily has
the same format. The number of bytes in each line of the hex file may
differ from the original depending on whether the original was produced
by an assembler or was read from an eprom.

Each output line is in the following format:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>LABEL:</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>OPCODE</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>OPERANDS</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td>; COMMENT</td></tr>
</table>

The label field will be generated only if the address of the code
is referenced by some other code (a call, for instance), or if the
user has specified a label for that address in the control file.
The comment field is only generated if the user specifies the D
option on the command line. Comments begin with a semicolon and are
followed by the hexadecimal address of the instruction, the hex
value of the byte(s) for the instruction, and finally by the ascii
representation of the instruction byte(s). For example:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>X004f:</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>orl</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>p3,#0ffh</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>; 004f</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>43 b0 ff</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>C0.</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>label</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>opcode</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>operands</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>comment</td></tr>
</table>

Several things should be noted in this example. The label is 'X'
followed by the address of the instruction in four hex digits.
This type of label is created by the disassembler when some other
code references the address. If the user specifies a label name for
the address in the control file ('what' for example), the generated
code becomes:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>what:</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>orl</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>p3,#0ffh</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>; 004f</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>43 b0 ff</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>C0.</td></tr>
</table>

If the user were to specify the symbol 'ones' for the value 0ffH,
the output would then become:

<table cellspacing=5 summary="">
  <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>what:</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>orl</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>p3,#ones</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>; 004f</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>43 b0 ff</td>
      <td></td><td></td><td></td><td>C0.</td></tr>
</table>

Also note the ascii representation of the instruction bytes. Bit
7 is forced to zero so that ascii with the high bit set can be
viewed (b0H in the example becomes 30H, which is ascii '0'). Any
code which is not printable ascii (a control code, for example)
is output as a period. This is the case for the byte 0ffH above.
<br><br>
The comment field starts at a different position in the output
line depending on the type of data in the input file. For normal
executable code, the comment field starts in column 32; for hex
data it starts at column 49, and for ascii data it starts in
column 56. For many programs, this makes for a more readable
source file, but if there is a mix of data types in a short range
of addresses, this can lead to some strange looking formatting.
The user may want to correct this with a text editor in the final
disassembly before modification and reassembly.

<h4><em>Summary</em></h4>
<hr>

D52 is distributed under the GNU General Public License. See the file COPYING
for details. D52 versions 3.1 and higher are a continuation of the earlier
disassembler named D51.
<br><br>
D52 allows the user to specify how code should be disassembled via a control
file that defines given areas of the code as ascii text, binary data or other
types of non-executable code. By an iterative process of disassembly, control
file modification, and further disassembly, the user can obtain a very readable
source file that can then be modified and re-assembled by a cross assembler.
Several public domain cross assemblers are available.
<br><br>
I've encountered several problems when reassembling the output of D52.
Almost all are due to the cross assembler not recognizing SFRs of some
of the newer or more exotic 8052 variants. The D52 tables include
names for all SFRs that I'm aware of as of May 1995 (there are likely
some that I'm not aware of). Such errors might be corrected just by
defining a symbol for the SFR in the control file (see the
<a href="#fdirective">F directive</a>
), but this depends on whether your cross assembler will accept it as a
valid operand. If all else fails, replace the offending instruction
with a 'db' pseudo op and put the mnemonic and operand in a comment.
A similar problem is the assembler not being able to handle a bit
addressable SFR address; the only solution I see to this is to use a
'db' pseudo op. All other problems I've seen (not many) have been due
to disassembling data as code; this is easily corrected by modifying
the control file to specify the correct data type.
<br><br>

Many thanks to numerous beta testers who have made invaluable
suggestions for improvement and found more bugs than I care to think about.
Also thanks to all the users who have, over the years, also made significant
contributions to the betterment of D52. Any remaining deficiencies are solely
my fault.
